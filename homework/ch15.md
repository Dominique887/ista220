1. a proprty looks like a field
2. a property acts like method
3. encapusalation gives acurate date by using private class or propertirs
4. no  exception occurs because the get and set accessors reference the property (uppercase ) rather than the private field (lowercase ), which causes an endless recursive loop that eventually causes the process use up all the memory

5. the instances were you wpuld us a read only wpuld be when you need to make a call of get an accessor versus a write only you would be setting your propery
6. passwords, You can change the accessibility of only one of the accessors when you define it.
The modifier must not specify an accessibility that is less restrictive than that of the property.
7. You can assign a value through a property of a structure or class only after the structure or class has been initialized. 
8. code that calls the default constructor and then calls the set accessor of each named property to initialize it with the value specified.
