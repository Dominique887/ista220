 1. try,catch, and finally statement also signals theres a error

 2. in a try block that is executed with no errors the code will run until completion

 4.  the program will terminate with an unhandled exception
 
 5. SYSTEM EXCEPTION, EXCEPTION,  they both catch every possible exception that can occur
