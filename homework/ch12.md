1. the second time you write the second piece of code you stop and call that method

2. {...}

3.  class come from base classes but structures do not 

4.  the compiler builds one for you

5. yes as long as the type used is a class that is higher up the inheritance hierarchy

6. no because it doesn't fit in to the hierarchy of inheritance 

7. yes 

8. to silence the warning message when calling two methods with the same parameter and name 

9. a method intended to be overridden you would use this when you wanna replace one method with another

10. a mechanism for providing different implementations of the same method while all the methods are the related /when being class specific

11. Add a static public method to a static class the first parameter must be of the type being extended, preceded by the THIS keyword.

12.  when you would need to extend to a type without affecting the code
