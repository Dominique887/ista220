2. yes the >> operator inserts either 2 00 on the left side of a binary code so 204 in decimal look like this:11001100 but with the right shit operator it would look like this: 00110011 
3. this code will set a 1  depending on were the bit postion is 
4. this cod will set a 1 to indexer bit 

5. this code will set a 0 depending on were the bit postion  is 
6. retrieves bool at indexer n
7. set bit at index n to true (1)
8. inverts the value of n (0)
9. 5 would
