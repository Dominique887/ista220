1. a collection of objects/contract
2. it includes the name and parameter with the method implemented
3. no
4. declare the name of the interface then replace the method body with a semicolon
5. yes you remove the depend code from the concrete class 
6. yes
7. no
8. Explicitly implementing an interface means calling the entire path
9. Restrictions are:
Cant define any fields in an interface not even as static fields. Not allowed to define any constructors in an interface. Not allowed to define a destructor in an interface. Cant specify access modifier for any method. Cant nest any types. Interfaces aren't allowed to inherit from one another.
10. The difference between abstract and interface is an abstract class can inherit variables and methods, interfaces are just inheriting methods.
11. An abstract method is only allowed to be used for objects inherited from that class. You cant create instances of that class, its only used for inheriting.
12. A sealed class cant be inherited from any other classes and can only be instantiated.
13. A sealed method can only be used by objects of that class, not even objects that inherit from that class can use it.
