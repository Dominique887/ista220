1. an object unmanaged resource either directly or indirectly using a destructor can be useful because they are commonly used
2. when the reference count goes to zero then at that point its no longer in your hands

3. //the process of destroying an object and returning the memory back to the heap known as garbage collection you use a destructor to clean up the garbage 

4. (~) followed by the class name closes file/ (filename) open class

5. memory database files handles and memory your only option in these scarce resources are to release the resource

6. a way to make sure the disposal method is always called, regardless of whether there is an exception

7. Using statement works by disposing all resources inside the using block as soon as the using block ends

8. If you try to dispose of something already disposed of you could get an exception error.

9. Maybe threads are able to dispose resources while running other code at the same time

10.  You shouldn't force the garbage collector because its an expensive process and the computer knows when you need to dispose something like when you're low on memory or when the program ends and it'll do it automatically for you. The exception to this rule is if you're dealing with large data sets like multidimensional arrays and need to dispose of them as soon as possible.
